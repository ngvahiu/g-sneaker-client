After cloning this project, using command ```npm install``` to install all necessary packages. In this app, I have used some notable packages: ``axios`` (for caling API), ``react-transition-group`` (for animations)

## Other scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.


## Deployment
I used Vercel to deploy this application. The  G-sneaker can be [viewed online here](https://g-sneaker-client.vercel.app/). Because I used [render](https://render.com/) with free subscription to deploy G-sneaker server, so it may take a while to get response when there are no requests to this server for a long time.
